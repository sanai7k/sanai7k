# Hello! I'm sanai

Undergraduate student at **Kyushu University**, majoring in **Atmospheric Fluid Dynamics**.  
My academic background is in geophysical fluid dynamics, and I am currently shifting focus toward computational science, especially in the context of fluid modeling and simulation.

## 💡 Interests

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, with a particular focus on **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**
- **Parallel computing** and **GPU acceleration** for high-performance simulation
- **Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD)** and its numerical modeling
- Scientific computing using **Julia**

## 🛠️ Skills

- **Programming languages**: C, Fortran, Julia, Python
- **Topics of interest**: CFD, GFD, AMR, HPC, numerical methods
- **Currently learning**: Parallel algorithms, numerical PDE solvers, and domain-specific optimization techniques

## 🔧 Current Work (Starting Soon)

- Implementing basic fluid-related models (e.g., **diffusion equation**) to build simulation foundations
- Developing a **2D linear shallow water model** to study **Matsuno–Gill-type responses**, using C++ or Julia
- Exploring **mass-conserving AMR techniques** for applications to large-scale geophysical flow simulations
